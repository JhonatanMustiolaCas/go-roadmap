## Type assertions

A _type assertion_ provides access to an interface value's underlying concrete value.

t := i.(T)

This statement asserts that the interface value `i` holds the concrete type `T` and assigns the underlying `T` value to the variable `t`.

If `i` does not hold a `T`, the statement will trigger a panic.

To _test_ whether an interface value holds a specific type, a type assertion can return two values: the underlying value and a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.

t, ok := i.(T)

If `i` holds a `T`, then `t` will be the underlying value and `ok` will be true.

If not, `ok` will be false and `t` will be the zero value of type `T`, and no panic occurs.

Note the similarity between this syntax and that of reading from a map.

## Type switches

A _type switch_ is a construct that permits several type assertions in series.

A type switch is like a regular switch statement, but the cases in a type switch specify types (not values), and those values are compared against the type of the value held by the given interface value.

switch v := i.(type) {
case T:
    // here v has type T
case S:
    // here v has type S
default:
    // no match; here v has the same type as i
}

The declaration in a type switch has the same syntax as a type assertion `i.(T)`, but the specific type `T` is replaced with the keyword `type`.

This switch statement tests whether the interface value `i` holds a value of type `T` or `S`. In each of the `T` and `S` cases, the variable `v` will be of type `T` or `S` respectively and hold the value held by `i`. In the default case (where there is no match), the variable `v` is of the same interface type and value as `i`.

## Stringers

One of the most ubiquitous interfaces is [`Stringer`](https://go.dev/pkg/fmt/#Stringer) defined by the [`fmt`](https://go.dev/pkg/fmt/) package.

type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

A `Stringer` is a type that can describe itself as a string. The `fmt` package (and many others) look for this interface to print values.
